# CalorieCalculator
=Java=
It calculates BMI (Body Mass Index) considering the user's weight, gender, and height, as well as suggesting how many calories per day an individual should consume depending on their goal (gaining, losing, or maintaining weight) 

The problem I am trying to solve is to have a creative tool to help assist people trying to check their suggested daily calorie intake depending on their goals. I used the formulas to calculate the body mass index (BMI) and obtain information from the user: weight, gender, height, and how often they exercise. The user will need to have those details so the program can be accurate, after that it will prompt the information about the BMI and the suggested calories, for example, if someone is trying to lose weight it will prompt how many calories per day the user needs to consume to make that happen.
